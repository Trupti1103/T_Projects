# Coffee_chain_Analysis

Coffee Chain Company wanted to understand why are they not making any profit. 

We analyzed data for 2 years for all the stores of different states in all regions. 

We observed that overall they have exceeded their sales and profit but they have also surpassed their COGS target and also some of the products,stores and states are not making any profit but have huge expenses and so we have highlighted them in the dashboard
