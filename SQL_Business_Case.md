**#SQL Business Case - TARGET, BRAZIL**

We have analyzed approximately 100K e-commerce orders received in Brazil from 2016 to 2018 using data from Orders, Customers, Products, Order_details, Sellers, Payments, Order_review, and Geolocation Excel documents to understand insights on geographical reach, market trends, seasonality, customer buying pattern, operational efficiency, and finances. We have also provided some recommendations for business growth while having operational efficiency.

Observation:

Approximately 100K orders on Target Brazil e-commerce platform that were executed in the time period from September 2016 to October 2018 were analysed. Target Brazil has reached 4119 cities of 27 states in Brazil but it is observed that maximum customers are concentrated in the southern coastal and coastal region of Brazil compared to Northern and western regions of Brazil. Trend graphs of orders across years show growth in orders from 2016 to 2018 but with continuous rise and fall peaks. November 2017 showed maximum sales. However, after the successful month of August 2018 we can see a steep fall in September 2018 and a detailed survey or analysis should be conducted to understand the reason for this fall. Also, to have an upward trend of orders across all months, focus should be made on increasing sales by increasing the customer count in some regions and displaying seasonal items or reducing TAT across most cities. We also analysed the time at which customer prefer to buy in a day and have understood that Brazilian people tend to buy more in afternoon followed by night and morning so any promotional activity is encouraged during morning or afternoon time, also to increase sale in dawn time or morning Target can provide special offer to people purchasing in this time period. We can observe a 136% increase in the count of orders in Jan to Aug 2018 compared to Jan to Aug 2017 but it is only 20% when all the months in 2017 and 2018 are considered which is because of the fall in orders from September onwards so need to understand the reason of this fall to avoid it in future. After analysing the mean and total sum and freight price it is seen that states that had maximum orders and were close to coastal region had high total price and freight value whereas the average price and freight value was lower but in states with less orders and were in northern or western region average freight value and price was higher compared to total price and freight value. Analysis on difference in the purchase date, actual delivery date and estimated delivery date highlighted that the time to delivery, estimated delivery time and difference in actual delivery date and estimated date is very high so to increase the sales this difference should be as minimum as possible and this can be achieved by efficiently managing the stock, partnering up with local vendors and shipping company, reduction in TAT by optimal operations etc. Average freight value, average time to delivery and average difference in actual and estimated time is higher in the states that are located in the northern and western region compared to states that are in coastal or southern coastal regions. After performing payment type analysis it is seen that maximum orders were paid by Credit card and then by UPI so Target can discuss with the bank to give more offers on the Credit card payments or on other payment options to increase the orders from the customer group that does not use credit card. Also all the payments were made in 1 instalment so Target can offer customer recommendations to increase their spending at Target and for longer duration if required. Target can also plan to build warehouses either in the northern, western or central region to reduce the freight cost, time to delivery and difference in actual and estimated delivery thus increasing the customer & order count and price of sales. They can also research the competitorâ€™s prices and estimated delivery time to negotiate for better transit while partnering with the shipping companies.
